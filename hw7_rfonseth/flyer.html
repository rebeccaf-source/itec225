    <p>HTML is the Web's core language for creating content for <strong>everyone to use anywhere</strong>
        The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML.</p>
    <p>HTML was originally designed as a language for semantinally describing scientific documents,
        but its general design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe
        a number of other types of documents.</p>

    <p>Style sheets describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they
        are pronounced. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet mechanism that has been
        specifically developed to meet the needs of Web designers and users.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. It is a small and
        lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can
        be connected to the objects of its environments to provide programmatic control over them </p>
    <p><em>Client-side JavaScript</em> extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
        browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an
        application to place elements on an HTML form and respons to user events such as mouse clicks,
        form input, and page navigation.</br></br></br></br></p>
